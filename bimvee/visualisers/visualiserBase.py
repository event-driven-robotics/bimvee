Intended as part of bimvee (Batch Import, Manipulation, Visualisation and Export of Events etc)
Functionality for serving images which represent the data at a certain time
(or given a certain time window). 
The intended use case is to support video-like playback of data
There is a generic Visualiser class - it contains a dataType dict. 
This is subclassed for each supported dataType (e.g. dvs, frame, pose etc)
Each subclass should implement basic methods: get_dims, get_frame, get_colorfmt
Implementing set_data allows the visualiser to do some preparation for visualisation
when it receives new data.

In general get_frame takes two args: time, and time_window.
In general one could think about representing data in an interpolated way or not.
For example, with poses, imu etc, one could interpolate between samples, 
or one could simply choose the sample which is nearest in time.
Likewise for frames. 
The time_window parameter says how much data to take around the sample point for event-type data.
It might be possible to develop visualisations for other types of data that make use of the concept of a time window. 

colorfmt is a choice between luminance and rgb. 
If luminance, then the frame returned should have dim 2 = 3.
Nothing stops the calling function from applying a color mask to an output in luminance format.
